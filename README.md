### _We work for :star2:’s and :fork_and_knife:’s ... please Star our repo_

:raising_hand: __Hey there!__   
Please note: This project is still in Alpha Version and we’re actively working on forking over a lot of nifty features from SwiftEngine to make it compatible with SwiftNIO.   We appreciate any contributors or testers joining our project!

## Features :heart_eyes:

* ___Swift on Back-End___ - Improve productivity by using the modern Swift language for all your app's development needs ([learn more](/TechnicalOverview.md))
* ___Hot Code Reload___ - Increase the speed of your endpoints as each file is individually compiled. If a file has not been modified since it was last used, it won't need to be recompiled ([learn more](/TechnicalOverview.md))
* ___Automated Routing Logic___ - Avoid writing custom routers; SwiftEngine will automagically route each request to the desired file ([learn more](/TechnicalOverview.md))
* ___Uptime Resiliency___ - Reduce risk by leveraging a fail-safe and high-availability operating environment where each client requests functions independently ([learn more](/TechnicalOverview.md))
* ___Easy web based run-time error analysis___ - Save time by not having to dig through shell dumps; SwiftEngine displays the full error trace on your browser for easy debugging ([learn more](/TechnicalOverview.md))


## Getting Started :boom:
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Prerequisites :exclamation:
What are the dependencies we need to get this to work?  

OS  | Version
------------- | -------------
macOS | 10.13+
Ubuntu  | 14.04, 16.04, 16.10

## Getting started with the project :thumbsup:

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/swiftengine/SwiftEngine.git`
2. `cd` to `SwiftEngine` directory and run `sudo ./install.sh`
3. Run `./run.sh`
This should start the server running and listening on port `8887`

## Using :star:

Programming your site:
1. Create a new `mypage.swift` file within the `/var/swiftengine/www/` directory (see example below)
2. From the browser, enter the following url `http://<machine_ip>:8887/mypage` (by default this is `localhost:8887`)

That's it!  No compilation or dealing with shell dumps required!  Your requested endpoints will be automagically compiled during the first request, and results will be shown.

Any swift file you place in `/var/swiftengine/www` will be accessible through the browser without the `.swift` extension.
Read more about SwiftEngine's autonomous system and routing logic ([here](/TechnicalOverview.md))

## Example of a SwiftEngine based `.swift` file  :trophy:

```swift
// Import SwiftEngine essentials
import SwiftEngine


// specify other required files for this file
//se: require /common.swift

// Entry Point function; where all code begins
func entryPoint(ctx: RequestContext) {

	// add GET handlers to the request context
	ctx.addHandler(forMethod:"GET", withRoute:"*"){
		req, res in
		res.write("Hello from SwiftEngine!")
	}

	// add POST handlers to the request context
	ctx.addHandler(forMethod:"POST", withRoute:"*"){
		req, res in
		res.write("Handle for POST request method")
	}

	// add catch-all handlers to the request context
	ctx.addHandler(forMethod:"*", withRoute:"*"){
		req, res in
		res.write("Handle for catch-all")
	}

}
```
